The syntax for the scp command is:
scp [options] [[user@]host1:]filename1 ... [[user@]host2:]filename2

For example, if user dvader is on a computer called empire.gov, and wants to copy a file called file1.txt to a directory called somedir in his account on a computer called deathstar.com, he would enter:
scp file1.txt dvader@deathstar.com:somedir

Likewise, if he wanted to copy the entire contents of the somedir directory on deathstar.com back to his empire.gov account, he would enter:
scp -r dvader@deathstar.com:somedir somedir

Similarly, if he is working on another computer, but wanted to copy a file called file1.txt from his home directory on empire.gov to a directory called somedir in his account on deathstar.com, he would enter:
scp dvader@empire.gov:file1.txt dvader@deathstar.com:somedir

When using wildcards (e.g.,  *  and  ? ) to copy multiple files from a remote system, be sure to enclose the filenames in quotes. This is because the Unix shell, not the scp command, expands unquoted wildcards.
